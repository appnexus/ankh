# Ankh [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/appnexus/ankh.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/appnexus/ankh)

<img src="ankh.png" width="175" height="175">
Another Kubernetes Helper for shipping code.

## Dependencies
Ankh uses kubectl and helm under the hood, make sure you install them.

- Kubectl: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/
- Helm (version 2.7 or newer): https://github.com/kubernetes/helm

## Build and Installation

### Using `make`
```
make # builds to ankh/ankh
```
```
make install # installs to $GOPATH/bin
```

### Using `go get`
```
go get github.com/appnexus/ankh/ankh
```

## Introduction

**Ankh** is a command line tool that wraps **helm template** and **kubectl apply**.

Ankh helps organizations manage multiple application deployments across different namespaces. Users get to manage their deployments using Helm charts, but without the additional complexity of running Tiller.

Multiple application deployments may be expressed in a single file:

```
$ cat ankh.yaml
namespace: mynamespace

charts:
  - name: haste-server
    version: 0.0.1
    default-values:
      some-value: "that you need"
      more-values:
        x: 1
        y: true
  - name: zoonavigator
    version: 0.0.1
    values:
      production:
        foo: 'very prod'
      dev:
        foo: 'not so prod'
        bar: false
```

Simplicity, transparency and composability are the primary design goals of Ankh.

**ankh inspect** lets you inspect helm chart files, helm templates, and ankh-derived yaml values.

**ankh template** runs `helm template` with all derived yaml values, prefixing any logging output with a comment `#` to ensure the output is still valid yaml.

**ankh explain** outputs a bash-compatible representation of the underlying invocations to `helm template` and `kubectl apply`.

**ankh apply** runs `kubectl apply` using the `helm template` output.

Ankh makes it easy to observe and verify incremental changes. It can be used to achieve reproducible deployments when combined with source control, or even simple CI / CD pipelines.

## Configuration

### Contexts

**Ankh** configs are driven by *contexts*, much like kubectl. When Ankh is invoked, it uses the *current-context* to decide which kubectl context, environment-class, and other common configurations to use.

**Note**: `current-context` will be removed in the next major version of Ankh. Use the `--context` flag on individual commands instead if you need to target a single context.

```
$ cat ~/.ankh/config
current-context: minikube
contexts:
  minikube-local:
    kube-context: minikube
    environment-class: production
    resource-profile: constrained
    helm-registry-url: https://helm-registry.myorganization.net/helm-repo/charts
    global:
      ingress:
        host: localhost
      some-value: 'needed by all charts'
```

You can view available contexts from your ankh config using:

```
ankh config get-contexts
```

...and switch to one via use-context

```
ankh config use-context my-context
```

You can also specify the context to use via a command line flag:
```
ankh --context my-context apply
```

The config/context API design was taken straight from kubectl, for a familiar feel.

You may include other yaml config files into your ankh config via the `include` property. This is useful if you need to keep multiple ankh configs in sync, perhaps across multiple developers on a team. E.g.

```
$ cat ~/.ankh/config

include:
- https://some-config-server.net/production.yaml
- https://some-config-server.net/staging.yaml
- https://some-config-server.net/development.yaml

...
```

Note: you may only `use-context` on contexts defined inside your ankh config, not any contexts from `include`. Just use `--context` or `--environment` for those.

### Environments
Environments are a list of context names. Using an environment is good for when you have multiple contexts to `apply` to as part of one atomic action. These must be valid context names present under `contexts`. A good example of this would be multiple geo-distributed clusters that you want to deploy to as part of a "staging" environment:

```
environments:
  staging:
    contexts:
    - nym-staging
    - ams-staging
    - lax-staging
```

When you invoke `ankh apply` with the `--environment` flag, it will do an `ankh apply` to each of the contexts defined in the environment in the order listed. E.g.

```
ankh --environment staging apply
```

### Ankh files

Once your ankh config contains the set of contexts and you've selected one via *use-context*, the primary source of input to ankh will be an Ankh file, typically named ankh.yaml

```
$ cat ankh.yaml | head -n15
namespace: utils

charts:
  - name: haste-server
    version: 0.0.1
    default-values:
      tag: latest
      ingress:
        host: haste.myorganization.net
    resource-profiles:
      constrained:
        haste-server:
          cpu: 0.1
          memory: 64Mi
      natural:
```

An Ankh file tracks the target namespace and all of the charts you want to manage.

### Ankh yaml in Charts

Ankh supports reading from three special files in a chart, in the following order of precedence:

* ankh-values.yaml
* ankh-resource-profiles.yaml
* ankh-releases.yaml

These files should be structured the the same way they would be if they were present as keys, less `ankh-`, in an Ankh file.
See YAML schemas below for more on `values`, `resource-profiles`, and `releases`.
