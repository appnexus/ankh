# current-context defines which context you currently have "selected". It's
# common for this value to change frequently as you move around to different
# clusters.
current-context: minikube

# supported-environment-classes define a list of your supported environment classes.
# Used for validation of ankh files. It's best practice to keep this value in sync with
# the rest of your teams so there isn't drift.
supported-environment-classes:
  - dev
  - production

# supported-resource-profiles define a list of your supported profiles. Used for
# validation of ankh files. Resource profiles are typically used for values that relate
# to how beefy your app needs to be. If you're running a production cluster that
# customers can hit, you'll probably want to support a value like "natural".
# Alternatively if you want your app to run on a resource strapped local
# cluster, you might consider also supporting something like "constrained". It's
# best practice to keep this value in sync with the rest of your teams so there
# isn't drift.
supported-resource-profiles:
  - natural
  - constrained
